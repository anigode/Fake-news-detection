### Fake News Detection Project
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning models. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as either Fake News or Not Fake News. The project employs various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest.

## Introduction
Fake news is a growing problem in today's digital age. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying fake news articles based on the textual content of the article. The model uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to perform this classification.

## Installation
To set up the project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python libraries as listed in the requirements.txt file.
- Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed (preferably version 3.6 or above).

## Usage
Once set up, you can place your dataset (containing real and fake news) in the project directory and execute the analysis. The project processes the data, trains machine learning models, and generates predictions. The dataset must contain text data representing the news articles.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains news articles, with important features including:

- title: The title of the news article.
- text: The full content of the article.
- subject: The category to which the article belongs (e.g., Politics, News).
- date: The date the article was published.
- class: The target variable that indicates whether the article is real (1) or fake (0).

## Data Preprocessing
In this project, several data preprocessing steps are carried out to ensure the model performs optimally. These steps include removing unwanted columns (such as the title, subject, and date), cleaning the text (removing punctuation, special characters, etc.), and converting the text into numerical form using a vectorization technique.

## Models
The following machine learning models are applied in this project:
- Logistic Regression: A model used for binary classification problems.
- Decision Tree Classifier: A non-linear model that splits the dataset into nodes based on feature values.
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: An ensemble technique that improves model accuracy by boosting weak classifiers.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning model that builds multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
Each model is trained on the dataset and evaluated based on its ability to classify articles as fake or real.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as:
- Accuracy: This metric evaluates the proportion of correctly classified articles.
- Classification Report: The report provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (Fake News and Not Fake News).
The results from these metrics help determine the effectiveness of each model.

## Libraries
This project makes use of several Python libraries, including:
- pandas for data manipulation.
- numpy for numerical computations.
- seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.
- scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
